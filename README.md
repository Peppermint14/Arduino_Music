# Arduino_Music

Playing around with my Arduino Uno I saw the possibility of playing songs on it with a speaker.
Getting annoyed by having to write or download a new .ino file for every song I thought about using them as C header files and importing them in the main Arduino File.

Additionaly I'm trying to get a python converter going so that I can convert scoresheets from Musescore directly into usable headers for fast conversion.
